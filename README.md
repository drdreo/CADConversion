# CADConversion - Auth0 Angular Forge NodeJS

# App
## Development server

Run `npm run start` for the Angular App. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `npm build` to build the production bundle of the app. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory.


# Server

## API Server

Run `npm run server:api` for the node server that serves the API for the app.

### Production
For a production environment, you got to ensure that if the server crashes it automatically restarts. Use `npm run server:start:prod` and `npm run server:stop:prod` to do so.
